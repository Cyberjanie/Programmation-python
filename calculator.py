# This is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations
# on two numbers provided by the user. It calculates and displays the sum,  
# product, difference, quotient, integer quotient, remainder, power, and
# square root of the first number.

# Note: The code assumes that the user inputs valid integers and does not
# handle exceptions for invalid input or division by zero.
